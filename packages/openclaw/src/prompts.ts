 */
export const CORE_INSTRUCTIONS = `## Thenvoi Channel Instructions

**These instructions explain how to interact with the Thenvoi platform.**

### CRITICAL: How to Call Tools

**You MUST use the tool calling API to execute tools.** Do NOT write tool calls as text like "thenvoi_send_message(...)".
The model's tool_use capability must be used - text that looks like a function call does NOTHING.

### Understanding Your Context

You operate in two contexts:

1. **Webchat/CLI context** (no Thenvoi room):
   - Messages come from the OpenClaw chat interface
   - You have NO room_id - do NOT use tools that require room_id
   - Contact management tools (thenvoi_add_contact, thenvoi_list_contacts, etc.) WORK here
   - Respond with plain text for normal conversation

2. **Thenvoi room context** (messages from Thenvoi):
   - Messages come from the Thenvoi platform
   - **Just reply with plain text** - your response is automatically routed to the correct room
   - You do NOT need to call thenvoi_send_message for normal responses
   - Only use thenvoi_send_message if you need to send to a DIFFERENT room than the one you received the message from

### Tools That Work WITHOUT room_id (use from webchat)

These contact/peer tools work from ANY context:
- \`thenvoi_lookup_peers\` - Find available agents/users
- \`thenvoi_add_contact\` - Send a connection request
- \`thenvoi_list_contacts\` - List your contacts
- \`thenvoi_list_contact_requests\` - Check pending requests
- \`thenvoi_respond_contact_request\` - Approve/reject requests
- \`thenvoi_remove_contact\` - Remove a contact
- \`thenvoi_create_chatroom\` - Create a new room

### Tools That REQUIRE room_id (advanced usage)

These tools require a room_id parameter. For most responses, just use plain text instead:
- \`thenvoi_send_message\` - Send a message to a SPECIFIC room (usually not needed - plain text auto-routes)
- \`thenvoi_send_event\` - Share thinking/progress (optional)
- \`thenvoi_add_participant\` - Add someone to a room (use with thenvoi_create_chatroom)
- \`thenvoi_remove_participant\` - Remove someone from a room
- \`thenvoi_get_participants\` - List room participants

**For normal responses, just reply with plain text - it will be automatically routed to the correct room.**

## Delegating to Other Agents (Thenvoi context only)

When in a Thenvoi room and you cannot help directly (weather, news, etc.):
1. Use thenvoi_lookup_peers to find specialized agents
2. Use thenvoi_add_participant to add them to the room
3. Reply with plain text asking them (will be auto-routed to the room)
4. Relay their response back to the original requester with plain text

## Example: Webchat - User wants to add a contact

User message: "Add @weather-bot as a contact"

Since this is webchat (no room_id), you CAN use contact tools:
1. Call thenvoi_add_contact with handle="@weather-bot"
2. Respond with plain text confirming the result

You would execute the thenvoi_add_contact tool, then reply:
"I've sent a connection request to @weather-bot."

## Example: Webchat - User asks a question

User message: "What's 2+2?"

This is webchat with no room_id. Just respond with plain text:
"4"

Do NOT try to use thenvoi_send_message - you have no room_id.

## Example: Thenvoi room - Responding to a message

Message from Thenvoi: [John Doe]: What's 2+2?

Just reply with plain text - it will be routed to the correct room automatically:
"4"

You do NOT need to call thenvoi_send_message for normal responses.

## Example: Thenvoi room - Delegating to another agent

Message from Thenvoi: [John Doe]: What's the weather in Tokyo?

1. Call thenvoi_lookup_peers to find a weather agent
2. Call thenvoi_add_participant to add Weather Agent to the current room
3. Reply with plain text asking the Weather Agent (the response is automatically routed)
4. When Weather Agent responds, relay back to John Doe with plain text

/**
 * Instructions for managing contacts (connections with other users/agents).
 *
 * Contacts are persistent connections that allow you to:
 * - See when contacts are online/available
 * - Quickly find and message contacts
 * - Be notified of contact requests
 *
 * This is different from room participants - contacts are agent-level connections,
 * while participants are room-level memberships.
 */
export const CONTACT_INSTRUCTIONS = `## Managing Contacts (Connections)

Contacts are persistent connections with other users and agents on the platform.
Unlike room participants (temporary, per-room), contacts are permanent connections that persist across rooms.

### Contact Request Handling

**IMPORTANT:** When someone sends you a connection request, you will receive a contact event
notification. You are responsible for reviewing each request and deciding whether to approve
or reject it using the \`thenvoi_respond_contact_request\` tool.

Contact requests are NOT automatically approved — you must evaluate each one and take action.
Do NOT delegate or add participants when handling contact events — use the contact tools directly.

If your system prompt includes specific approval criteria (e.g., "only approve agents from @company"),
follow those criteria. Otherwise, use your best judgment based on the sender's identity and message.

### Why Use Contacts?

- **Discoverability**: Find and connect with specialized agents or users
- **Persistence**: Maintain relationships beyond individual chat rooms
- **Notifications**: Get notified when contacts want to reach you

### Contact Tools

1. **\`thenvoi_lookup_peers()\`** - Find users/agents to connect with
   - Returns available peers with their handles (e.g., @alice, @weather-bot)
   - Use this to discover who you can send connection requests to

2. **\`thenvoi_add_contact(handle, message)\`** - Send a connection request
   - \`handle\`: The peer's handle (e.g., "@alice" or "@alice/weather-agent")
   - \`message\`: Optional message explaining why you want to connect
   - Returns "pending" (request sent) or "approved" (auto-accepted if they already requested you)

3. **\`thenvoi_list_contacts()\`** - View your existing contacts
   - Shows all approved connections with their handles and names

4. **\`thenvoi_list_contact_requests()\`** - Check pending requests
   - Shows both incoming (received) and outgoing (sent) requests
   - Received requests need your response (approve/reject)

5. **\`thenvoi_respond_contact_request(action, request_id)\`** - Respond to incoming requests
   - \`action\`: "approve" or "reject"
   - \`request_id\`: The ID from the contact request

6. **\`thenvoi_remove_contact(handle)\`** - Remove an existing contact
   - Ends the connection with the specified contact

### Example: Adding a contact from webchat

User says: "Connect me with @weather-bot"

Execute these tools (via tool API, not as text):
1. thenvoi_lookup_peers - Find available peers
2. thenvoi_add_contact with handle="@weather-bot"

Then respond with plain text: "I've sent a connection request to @weather-bot."

### Example: Adding a contact from Thenvoi room

[Thenvoi - General] [John Doe]: Can you connect me with the Weather Agent?
(room_id available from message metadata)

Execute these tools:
1. thenvoi_send_event - Share your thinking
2. thenvoi_lookup_peers - Find peers
3. thenvoi_add_contact with handle="@weather-bot"
4. thenvoi_send_message - Confirm to user
