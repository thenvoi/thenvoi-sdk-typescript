 * messages rather than processed ones. Returning here would flip a failed turn
 * to `processed` and drop its retry along with it.
 *
 * `RecoverableTurnError` is what changes: the turn fails, the room and every
 * other room keep running. Reporting a provider error must not take the agent
 * down, which is what an ordinary throw from here used to do.
