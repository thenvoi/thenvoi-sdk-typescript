# Build, Tests, and Docs Review

Scope: `packages/sdk/` build/packaging, tests, examples, and documentation.

## Summary

The SDK is generally well-packaged: `tsup` entries align with the `package.json` exports map; every optional peer is correctly flagged in `peerDependenciesMeta`; ESLint runs with `recommended-type-checked` rules on `src/**`; vitest is wired with a v8 coverage provider; and the test directory covers nearly every adapter and runtime module 1:1. Test code is largely behavior-focused and uses typed fakes (e.g. `FakeTools`, `FakeRestApi`) instead of duck typing. The main shortcomings cluster around documentation and minor configuration polish.

**What's good:**

- `tsup` ↔ `exports` map alignment is correct; every entry has a matching tsup entry and vice versa, both ESM + CJS with sourcemaps and per-format `.d.ts`.
- All 17 optional peer dependencies are flagged `optional: true` in `peerDependenciesMeta`.
- ESLint runs with `recommended-type-checked` on `src/**`, `no-explicit-any: error`, and `no-unsafe-*` enabled.
- 96 test files map 1:1 to source modules; behavior-focused tests; typed fakes in `tests/testUtils.ts`.
- `tests/band-client-conformance.test.ts` instantiates the real REST client and asserts all ten `agentApi*` namespaces and 25 methods exist, with a deliberate red-check — exactly the contract test the network-layer Blocker asked for. `tests/phoenix-upgrade-errors.test.ts` (74 lines) and ~500 new lines in `tests/phoenix-channels-transport.test.ts` cover the disconnect-reason work.
- Examples are real and runnable (`linear-band-bridge-server.ts` doubles as the production bridge — though see [the verticals.md finding](./verticals.md#linear-band-bridge-serverts-is-713-loc-and-doubles-as-production-code) on why this dual role is also a problem).
- `AGENTS.md` is comprehensive and accurate — better than the user-facing README in coverage. (Though see [Architecture documentation is hidden under `AGENTS.md`](#architecture-documentation-is-hidden-under-agentsmd) on why the filename hurts discoverability.)

**What's not** (each linked to its full finding):

- [`npm install` fails with `ERESOLVE` on a `zod` peer conflict (SDK dev env and Claude-adapter consumers)](#npm-install-fails-with-eresolve-on-a-zod-peer-conflict-sdk-dev-env-and-claude-adapter-consumers).
- Public-API JSDoc is largely absent — 19 of 22 surveyed public-surface files have zero JSDoc blocks; only `Agent` and `SimpleAdapter` are consistently documented. See [Missing JSDoc on most public adapter classes and options interfaces](#missing-jsdoc-on-most-public-adapter-classes-and-options-interfaces), [Missing JSDoc on `Logger`, error classes, runtime config types](#missing-jsdoc-on-logger-error-classes-runtime-config-types), [Missing JSDoc on `contracts/protocols` public interfaces](#missing-jsdoc-on-contractsprotocols-public-interfaces).
- CHANGELOG drift and duplicate release entries — see [Stale/duplicated `packages/sdk/CHANGELOG.md`](#staleduplicated-packagessdkchangelogmd) and [Root `/CHANGELOG.md` is also out of date](#root-changelogmd-is-also-out-of-date).
- README/examples drift — see [`examples/README.md` references non-existent example](#examplesreadmemd-references-non-existent-example), [Root `README.md` Examples table omits `letta/`](#root-readmemd-examples-table-omits-letta), [Root `README.md` "Subpath Exports" table omits `@band-ai/sdk/converters`](#root-readmemd-subpath-exports-table-omits-band-aisdkconverters).
- tsconfig strictness gaps — see [`tsconfig.json` does not enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` or `noImplicitOverride`](#tsconfigjson-does-not-enable-nouncheckedindexedaccess-or-noimplicitoverride).
- [Test type-safety: 60+ `as never` or `as any` casts in tests](#test-type-safety-60-as-never-or-as-any-casts-in-tests).
- No status check is required to merge, and the suite never runs on the trunk — see [`main`'s ruleset requires a pull request but no passing checks](#mains-ruleset-requires-a-pull-request-but-no-passing-checks).
- The migration-proof suite does not run off POSIX, and half of its assertions pass vacuously when it cannot — see [Compile-proof tests are not portable off POSIX](#compile-proof-tests-are-not-portable-off-posix), [Part of the test suite silently requires a prior build](#part-of-the-test-suite-silently-requires-a-prior-build), [The brand guard assertion is line-ending sensitive](#the-brand-guard-assertion-is-line-ending-sensitive).

## Test suite state

`vitest run` at `1eb7bc9`: **898 tests across 96 test files — 871 pass, 23 fail, 4 skipped.** `tsc --noEmit` is clean and `eslint .` reports 0 errors with 12 warnings.

Note that these numbers cannot be read off CI. `ci.yml` triggers on `pull_request` only, so the suite never runs against `main` after a merge — the green checks on `main` are `release.yml` and CodeQL. See [`main`'s ruleset requires a pull request but no passing checks](#mains-ruleset-requires-a-pull-request-but-no-passing-checks).

The 23 failures need triage rather than a headline number, because only one of them is a defect in the repo:

| Failures | Cause | Verdict |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 16 | `c3-1`, `c4-2`, `c5-1`, `c5-2`, `c5-4b` shell out via `spawnSync(join(SDK_ROOT, "node_modules/.bin/tsc"), …)`. Off POSIX the extensionless `.bin/tsc` is a shell script, `spawnSync` returns `ENOENT`, and `status ?? 1` reports that as a compiler verdict. | Test-harness bug — [Compile-proof tests are not portable off POSIX](#compile-proof-tests-are-not-portable-off-posix). The code under test is fine, and worse, the assertions expecting *rejection* pass vacuously. |
| 1 | `c5-package-symbols.test.ts:420-421` asserts `.release-hold` exists at the repo root; `1eb7bc9` deleted that file. | **Genuine.** A red test on `main` — see [`.release-hold` marker finding](#c5-package-symbolstestts-asserts-a-release-hold-marker-that-head-deleted). |
| 1 | The stale-live-text guard compares `readme.split("\n")[0]` to an exact string, so a CRLF checkout leaves a trailing `\r`. | Test bug — [The brand guard assertion is line-ending sensitive](#the-brand-guard-assertion-is-line-ending-sensitive). |
| 2 | `adapters-import-boundary` and `root-import-boundary` exceed the default 5s timeout on a cold transform cache. | Environment-sensitive. A 5s budget for a test that transforms the whole adapter barrel is thin; worth raising. |
| 3 | `c6`/`c7` brand guards scan `git ls-files`, and any tracked document carrying legacy brand words trips them. | Guards working as designed. |

A further 8 failures appear on a fresh clone before `dist/` exists — see [Part of the test suite silently requires a prior build](#part-of-the-test-suite-silently-requires-a-prior-build). Reproducing the numbers above requires `pnpm build` first, and `--experimental-sqlite` on a Node version below the `node:sqlite` floor (see [Engine-version mismatch](#engine-version-mismatch-between-root-and-sdk)).

**Net: 1 real defect in the repo, 20 test-infrastructure problems, 2 marginal timeouts, 0 product-code regressions.** On Linux CI with a build step the suite is green apart from the `.release-hold` assertion.

Gaps:
- `src/mcp/sse.ts` and `src/mcp/stdio.ts` have no direct behavioral tests (only barrel-import smoke).
- `src/platform/streaming/nodeWebSocketFactory.ts` has no direct test, despite containing the handshake-header auth path and an `unexpected-response` → `error`/`close` translation that is easy to get wrong.
- `src/testing/` is not directly unit-tested.
- `src/core/isDirectExecution.ts` has no direct test (used transitively in example tests).

## Findings

### Blockers

#### `npm install` fails with `ERESOLVE` on a `zod` peer conflict (SDK dev env and Claude-adapter consumers)
*Blocker · Effort: M · `packages/sdk/package.json:95, :101, :172`*

**Observation** — The SDK pins `zod@^3.24.2` in `dependencies` (line 95), but `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.2.141` (the highest version satisfying the `devDependencies` range `^0.2.63`) declares `zod@^4.0.0` as a *peer*. So when the install resolver sees both `zod ^3.24.2` and the claude-agent-sdk peer requirement `zod ^4.0.0` in the same tree, the ranges don't overlap and npm 7+ refuses with `ERESOLVE`.

**Conditional breakage — depends on what's in the consumer's tree:**

| Scenario | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install @band-ai/sdk` in an empty folder | ✓ Works. Peers are marked `{ optional: true }` in `peerDependenciesMeta`, and `devDependencies` aren't installed for consumers. So `claude-agent-sdk` never enters the tree → no zod@^4 demand to conflict with. |
| Consumer wants to use the **Claude SDK adapter** and installs `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` alongside | ✗ Fails. Both your `zod@^3` and claude-agent-sdk's `zod@^4` peer requirement are now in the tree. |
| SDK maintainer running `npm install` inside `packages/sdk/` | ✗ Fails. `claude-agent-sdk` is in `devDependencies`, so it gets installed locally; its peer-on-zod-4 activates and conflicts with the direct `zod@^3` dep. |
| Anyone running `pnpm install` | ✓ Works. pnpm warns rather than fails on peer mismatches; this is why the bug went undetected — the project is pnpm-first (`packageManager: "pnpm@10.22.0"`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`). |

**Why npm picks `0.2.141` specifically — a `0.x` semver gotcha:** the dev-dependency range `"^0.2.63"` resolves to `>=0.2.63 <0.3.0`. For pre-1.0 packages, `^` and `~` are equivalent — both cap at the next minor, not the next patch. So `^0.2.63` accepts *every* future 0.2.x patch. As of install time, the highest published 0.2.x of `claude-agent-sdk` was `0.2.141`, so npm picked it. Crucially, **semver convention allows maintainers of `0.x` packages to ship breaking changes as patches**, because 0.x is treated as "API not yet stable." That's exactly what happened here: somewhere between 0.2.63 and 0.2.141, the maintainers tightened the zod peer from `^3` to `^4` — a breaking change shipped as a patch. The `^0.2.63` range happily accepted it. To actually prevent a patch upgrade from breaking you in `0.x` you have to either pin exactly (`"0.2.63"` — but then you miss bug fixes) or use a manually-maintained bounded ceiling (`">=0.2.63 <0.2.142"`). `^` and `~` won't save you. This trap goes away once `claude-agent-sdk` releases `1.0.0`: then `^1.x.x` will actually constrain to non-breaking changes per semver, because a future zod-major bump would force the maintainers to publish `2.0.0`, which `^1.x.x` would refuse.

**A second contradiction in the SDK's own ranges:** the two declarations of `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` in the SDK's `package.json` don't agree with each other — `peerDependencies` (line 101) is `">=0.2.63"` (open-ended, accepts any future major: 0.3.x, 1.x, etc.), while `devDependencies` (line 172) is `"^0.2.63"` (capped at `<0.3.0`). The peer range is broader than the dev range, which means a consumer could legally satisfy your peer requirement with a version you've never tested. Even if you bump zod to 4 (option 1 below), the peer range is still wrong — it should match the dev range.

**Impact** — Consumers using the Claude SDK adapter via npm are blocked. Consumers using *any other* adapter via npm are fine in an empty-tree install but will trip on the same conflict if anything else in their app brings claude-agent-sdk in transitively. Plus, the SDK's own development environment requires `pnpm` or `--legacy-peer-deps`, contradicting the implicit promise that this is "a regular npm package."

**Fix** — There is only one real path:

1. **Bump the SDK's `zod` to `^4.0.0`** and audit the code for zod 3 → 4 API differences (there are several breaking changes — `.parse()` error shape, `z.record()` signature, `.refine()`/`z.preprocess()` semantics, `z.string().email()` is now `z.email()`, error customization API, etc.). This is the only fix that unblocks every install path regardless of package manager and regardless of which adapter the consumer uses.
2. **Why "downgrade `claude-agent-sdk` to a pre-zod-4 version" is not viable:** querying npm for every published version of `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` shows the `zod@^4.0.0` peer is present in *every release*, including the earliest published version (`0.2.39`). There has never been a zod-3-compatible version. The earlier-suggested ceiling like `">=0.2.63 <0.2.142"` simply doesn't contain any working version.
3. **Why upgrading to `claude-agent-sdk@0.3.x` doesn't help:** `0.3.159` (current latest) keeps the same `zod@^4.0.0` peer and *adds* two new peer constraints (`@anthropic-ai/sdk: ">=0.93.0"`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk: "^1.29.0"`). It doesn't fix this issue and introduces additional coordination headaches.
4. **`pnpm.overrides` zod pin** is a temporary workaround for the SDK's own dev environment, but **does not propagate to consumers** — the Claude-adapter consumer path remains broken on npm. Don't ship the SDK relying on it.
5. **Broader audit recommendation:** the peer-range style across the SDK leans on open-ended `">=X"` for several optional peers, which sets up future B4-style traps every time one of those peers cuts a major release with a peer-dep change. Audit every `peerDependencies` entry in `packages/sdk/package.json` — open-ended `>=` should be replaced with bounded ranges representing the versions you've actually tested. Also reconcile the contradiction between the peer range (`>=0.2.63`) and the dev range (`^0.2.63`) for `claude-agent-sdk`; they should match.

### Major

#### Missing JSDoc on most public adapter classes and options interfaces
*Major · Effort: M · 5 adapter files (see Locations below)*

**Observation** — Adapter classes and their `*AdapterOptions` interfaces are exported from `@band-ai/sdk` (the package's primary surface) but carry no JSDoc. Only `SimpleAdapter` (well-documented at `src/core/simpleAdapter.ts:10-18`) and `Agent.create` are documented; everything else relies on README prose. README examples won't survive into editor tooltips.

**Impact** — Developers integrating the SDK have no inline documentation for the most commonly used types; they must cross-reference the README or source code to understand adapter options.

**Fix** — Add a 1-2 line behavior-focused JSDoc to each adapter class describing what framework it wraps, what tools it forwards, and what the options control. Same for `*AdapterOptions` (or per-field docs for non-obvious fields like `openAIModel`, `clientFactory`).

**Locations:**
- `packages/sdk/src/adapters/openai/OpenAIAdapter.ts:8-37`
- `packages/sdk/src/adapters/anthropic/AnthropicAdapter.ts:8-17`
- `packages/sdk/src/adapters/gemini/GeminiAdapter.ts` (analogous)
- `packages/sdk/src/adapters/codex/CodexAdapter.ts:67-130`
- `packages/sdk/src/adapters/GenericAdapter.ts:5-17`
- Plus most other adapters under `src/adapters/*`

[↑ Summary in review.md M14](../review.md#m14-jsdoc-missing-on-public-api-surface)

#### Missing JSDoc on `Logger`, error classes, runtime config types
*Major · Effort: M · 5 core files (see Locations below)*

**Observation** — These are core types that integrators routinely reference. `CustomToolDef` is now exported from the root entrypoint (commit a9c046b, INT-334) but still has zero JSDoc on the interface itself; users currently must read implementation to learn that `name` is required and `schema` must be an object.

**Impact** — Exported types that are part of the public API surface provide no guidance to consumers; discoverability relies entirely on README prose that doesn't appear in editor tooltips.

**Fix** — Add short JSDoc describing each interface and its semantically important fields. Document when each `BandSdkError` subclass is thrown.

**Locations:**
- `packages/sdk/src/core/logger.ts:1-6` (`Logger` interface)
- `packages/sdk/src/core/logger.ts:13-51` (`NoopLogger`, `ConsoleLogger`)
- `packages/sdk/src/core/errors.ts:1-35` (all five error classes)
- `packages/sdk/src/runtime/types.ts:9-79` (`AgentConfig`, `SessionConfig`, `ContactEventConfig`, `HistoryProvider`, etc.)
- `packages/sdk/src/runtime/tools/customTools.ts:4-9` (`CustomToolDef`)

[↑ Summary in review.md M14](../review.md#m14-jsdoc-missing-on-public-api-surface)

#### Missing JSDoc on `contracts/protocols` public interfaces
*Major · Effort: M · `packages/sdk/src/contracts/protocols.ts:21-95`*

**Observation** — Only `FrameworkAdapter` and `AdapterToolsProtocol` have minimal one-line JSDoc. Tool surface interfaces (`HistoryConverter`, `PlatformMessageLike`, `HistoryLike`, `MessagingTools`, `RoomParticipantTools`, `PeerLookupTools`, `ToolSchemaProvider`, `ContactTools`, `MemoryTools`, `ToolExecutor`) are exported through `@band-ai/sdk` and `@band-ai/sdk/core` but undocumented. Custom adapter authors and ACP/A2A integrators need this.

**Impact** — Custom adapter authors and ACP/A2A integrators have no inline guidance on what each protocol interface represents or what its methods expect; this directly increases integration friction for the most advanced SDK use cases.

**Fix** — Add one line per interface describing what tool surface it represents, and per-method JSDoc for non-obvious methods (e.g. `sendMessage(content, mentions?)` — note the mentions-required behavior).

[↑ Summary in review.md M14](../review.md#m14-jsdoc-missing-on-public-api-surface)

#### Stale/duplicated `packages/sdk/CHANGELOG.md`
*Major · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/CHANGELOG.md:1-29`*

**Observation** — Versions 0.1.1, 0.1.2, and 0.1.3 all reference the same PR (#22) with the identical feature line — appears to be release-please re-running on the same change. The file then jumps to 0.1.4 (band-ai publish) on 2026-04-02 and stops, while >20 feature commits land between then and now (Linear bridge, Dependabot, INT-334 export, INT-355 docs, INT-293 system prompt context, etc.). No release-please-pending PR is visible from this snapshot.

**Impact** — Consumers checking the changelog cannot determine what changed between published versions; the duplicate entries create noise that undermines trust in the release history.

**Fix** — Verify release-please isn't generating duplicates (likely a config bug — possibly the release type / scope detection); collapse 0.1.1-0.1.3 if a new release is cut; ensure the next release captures the post-0.1.4 work.

[↑ Summary in review.md M15](../review.md#m15-documentation-drift)

#### Root `/CHANGELOG.md` is also out of date
*Major · Effort: S · `/CHANGELOG.md:1-60`*

**Observation** — Last entry is 0.1.2 on 2026-03-25. The SDK has since cut 0.1.3 and 0.1.4, and ~30 feature/bugfix commits have landed.

**Impact** — The root CHANGELOG diverges from the SDK CHANGELOG, leaving contributors and repository visitors with an inaccurate view of the project's release history.

**Fix** — Either remove the root CHANGELOG if `packages/sdk/CHANGELOG.md` is the canonical source, or sync it on each release.

[↑ Summary in review.md M15](../review.md#m15-documentation-drift)

#### `examples/README.md` references non-existent example
*Major · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/examples/README.md:19`*

**Observation** — `dog-landing-page/` does not exist in `packages/sdk/examples/`. The actual folders, re-listed at `1eb7bc9`, are: `a2a-bridge`, `a2a-gateway`, `anthropic`, `basic`, `claude-sdk`, `codex`, `custom-adapter`, `gemini`, `langgraph`, `letta`, `linear-band`, `openai`, `parlant`.

**Impact** — Developers following the examples README will encounter a dead reference, undermining confidence in the documentation.

**Fix** — Remove the `dog-landing-page/` bullet; add `letta/` to the list.

[↑ Summary in review.md M15](../review.md#m15-documentation-drift)

#### Root `README.md` Examples table omits `letta/`
*Major · Effort: S · `/README.md:323-336`*

**Observation** — The "Examples" table lists basic, openai, anthropic, gemini, claude-sdk, codex, langgraph, custom-adapter, parlant, a2a-bridge, a2a-gateway, linear-band — but `examples/letta/letta-agent.ts` exists and the AGENTS.md "Core Features" section lists Letta. No row, no mention of Letta anywhere in README.

**Impact** — The `letta/` example is invisible to users consulting the README, reducing discoverability of the Letta integration.

**Fix** — Add `examples/letta/ | Letta | Letta-managed agent state` row, and a row for the memory example `#87` added. Also add a short README section under "Adapters" for `LettaAdapter` (currently absent despite being exported from the root).

[↑ Summary in review.md M15](../review.md#m15-documentation-drift)

#### Root `README.md` "Subpath Exports" table omits `@band-ai/sdk/converters`
*Major · Effort: S · `/README.md:306-317`*

**Observation** — The package ships an exports entry for `./converters` (`package.json:40-44`) backed by a real tsup entry (`tsup.config.ts:35`) and a populated barrel (`src/converters/index.ts`). The README's subpath table covers `adapters`, `mcp`, `mcp/claude`, `rest`, `linear`, `testing`, `config`, `core`, `runtime` but not `converters`. The internal `AGENTS.md` does list it.

**Impact** — Consumers are unaware the `@band-ai/sdk/converters` subpath exists, causing them to either re-implement converters or import them via internal paths.

**Fix** — Add a row to the README table: `@band-ai/sdk/converters | Per-framework history converters (ACP, A2A, Anthropic, Claude SDK, Codex, Gemini, Google ADK, LangChain, Opencode, Parlant, Vercel AI SDK)`.

#### `tsconfig.json` does not enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` or `noImplicitOverride`
*Major · Effort: M · `packages/sdk/tsconfig.json:2-17`*

**Observation** — `strict: true` is on but the two strict-adjacent flags most relevant for SDK code (array/Record access safety, override correctness) are off. Given the SDK has many `Record<string, unknown>` accesses, enabling `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` would catch real bugs.

**Impact** — Array and Record index accesses silently return `undefined` without a type error; class overrides are not verified, risking subtle behavioral divergence when base class signatures change.

**Fix** — Enable `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` and `noImplicitOverride: true`. Expect to fix a handful of access sites; worth the safety.

#### Test type-safety: 60+ `as never` or `as any` casts in tests
*Major · Effort: M · multiple test files (see Locations below)*

**Observation** — `eslint.config.js:36-39` explicitly disables `no-unsafe-*` in tests, but the repeated `as never` casts on mock runtimes/adapters indicate the test fakes could be expressed as small typed shapes. `tests/testUtils.ts` already shows the right pattern (`FakeTools implements AgentToolsProtocol`, `FakeRestApi implements RestApi`); the lighter unit tests fall back to inline `vi.fn() ... as never` casts. This is a code-quality drift, not a correctness issue.

**Impact** — Unsafe casts in tests bypass the type checker, meaning API signature changes may not surface as test failures; this weakens the suite's role as a type-level regression guard.

**Fix** — Extract typed mock builders (e.g., `createMockRuntime(overrides?)`, `createMockAdapter(overrides?)`) into `testUtils.ts` so individual tests stop reaching for `as never`.

**Locations:**

#### `c5-package-symbols.test.ts` asserts a `.release-hold` marker that HEAD deleted
*Blocker-adjacent · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/tests/c5-package-symbols.test.ts:420-421`*

**Observation** — `P-C5-3`'s `.release-hold marker exists at the repository root` asserts `existsSync(join(REPO_ROOT, ".release-hold"))` is `true`. Commit `1eb7bc9` — the current HEAD, *"chore: remove stale `.release-hold` from the Band rebrand"* — deleted that file and did not update the assertion, so `vitest run` against `main`'s own tree fails with `expected false to be true`. This was not a silent slip: on the pull request that made the change, the `test` job concluded failure with an annotation naming this exact line, and the aggregate `ci-status` check also concluded failure — see [`main`'s ruleset requires a pull request but no passing checks](#mains-ruleset-requires-a-pull-request-but-no-passing-checks) for why that didn't block the merge.

**Impact** — `main`'s tree carries a permanently failing test that nothing surfaces in normal operation, since `ci.yml` only runs on `pull_request` and never re-validates `main` after a merge. It also masks any real regression that happens to land in the same test file, and it invalidates the "all tests pass" assumption that any later verification pass over this repo would otherwise rely on.

**Fix** — The commit message and the merge both treat the marker's removal as intentional, so the fix is to delete the assertion (and the sibling expectation in the same `describe` block that the hold is present) rather than restore the file. If that reading turns out to be wrong and the hold is still required by the release pipeline, restore `.release-hold` and add a comment recording *why* it must exist, so a future cleanup pass doesn't delete it again without noticing.

#### `main`'s ruleset requires a pull request but no passing checks
*Major · Effort: S · `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (trigger), repository ruleset `main-branch-protection`*

**Observation** — Two configuration facts combine badly.

`ci.yml` — the workflow that runs lint, typecheck, and the test suite — triggers on `pull_request` only:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev]
```

Nothing runs it on a push to `main`. What runs there is `release.yml` (`on: push: branches: [main]`) plus CodeQL, so `main` shows green checks while its tree is never tested.

The `main-branch-protection` ruleset is `active` with no bypass actors, but its rules are only `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, and `pull_request`. There is **no `required_status_checks` rule**. A pull request is mandatory; a *passing* pull request is not.

The consequence is on record. The commit that deleted `.release-hold` was merged with `test` concluding **failure** and the aggregate `ci-status` check concluding **failure**, with an annotation naming the exact assertion — see [the `.release-hold` marker finding above](#c5-package-symbolstestts-asserts-a-release-hold-marker-that-head-deleted). CI did its job; nothing acted on the result, and because the suite never re-runs on `main`, the failure has been invisible since.

**Impact** — Red builds can land on the trunk and then stop being reported. The repo has invested heavily in guard tests — the `c3`–`c7` migration proofs, the REST-client conformance test, the release-hardening suite — and all of that investment is advisory as long as no check is required to pass. It also means "CI is green on `main`" cannot be used as evidence about `main`'s tree, which is exactly the inference a contributor will make.

**Fix** — Two changes, both small:

1. Add a `required_status_checks` rule to the `main-branch-protection` ruleset listing `ci-status` as the required context. **The gate itself is already written and correct** — `ci.yml:232-261` defines a `ci-status` job with `needs: [changes, lint, test, packaging]` and `if: always()`, which walks each job's result and exits 1 unless every one is `success` (or `skipped`, for the two that are conditional on `changes`). It even documents why `changes` is checked separately: a failure there skips `lint` and `test` rather than failing them, and treating skipped-because-broken as a pass would hide the break. So this is one setting, not a piece of work: the single context `ci-status` is enough. Keep `strict` on so a stale branch must update before merging.
2. Add `push: branches: [main]` to `ci.yml`'s trigger, so the trunk is validated after a merge and a regression that lands anyway is visible rather than silent.

Together these turn the existing guard suite from advisory into enforcing, which is the assumption most of its tests were written under.

#### Compile-proof tests are not portable off POSIX
*Major · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/tests/linear-c3-compatibility.test.ts:79-83`, `packages/sdk/tests/c4-room-metadata-storage.test.ts`, `packages/sdk/tests/c5-package-symbols.test.ts`*

**Observation** — The rename shipped an genuinely good idea: prove the migration by compiling a real consumer against the built package under NodeNext resolution, asserting the new symbol names compile and the old ones fail. Each of these tests copies `dist/` and `package.json` into a temp `node_modules/@band-ai/sdk`, writes a `tsconfig.json` and a consumer file, then shells out to the compiler:

```ts
const result = spawnSync(
  join(SDK_ROOT, "node_modules/.bin/tsc"),
  ["-p", join(tmpDir, "tsconfig.json")],
  { encoding: "utf8" },
);
return { status: result.status ?? 1, output: … };
```

On Windows, `node_modules/.bin/tsc` is a POSIX shell script — the executable forms are `tsc.CMD` and `tsc.ps1`. `spawnSync` without `shell: true` cannot run it, so it returns `error.code === "ENOENT"` and `status === null`, and the `?? 1` collapses that to `1`.

The failure mode is worse than a red test. **Both directions of every proof are corrupted, in opposite ways:**

- Tests asserting `expect(result.status).toBe(0)` (new names compile) fail — a false negative.
- Tests asserting `expect(result.status).not.toBe(0)` (old names must fail to compile) **pass for the wrong reason** — they pass because the compiler never ran, not because the old name was rejected. Those assertions are silently vacuous, and would keep passing even if the legacy symbols were accidentally re-exported.

Measured at `1eb7bc9`: 16 failures across `linear-c3-compatibility` (P-C3-1, 4), `c4-room-metadata-storage` (P-C4-2, 4), and `c5-package-symbols` (P-C5-1, P-C5-2, P-C5-4b, 8). Verified directly: `spawnSync("packages/sdk/node_modules/.bin/tsc", ["--version"])` returns `{ status: null, error: { code: "ENOENT" } }` on this platform.

**Impact** — The migration proofs do not run at all on Windows, and the half of them that assert *rejection* report success while proving nothing. Any contributor on Windows sees a permanently red suite and learns to ignore it, which is how the B5 assertion failure stayed invisible. On Linux CI the tests work, so this will not be caught there.

**Fix** — Resolve the binary per platform and stop treating a spawn failure as a compiler verdict:

1. Spawn the compiler through Node instead of the shim — `spawnSync(process.execPath, [require.resolve("typescript/lib/tsc.js"), "-p", cfg])`. This is platform-independent and needs no `shell: true`.
2. Fail loudly on a spawn error: if `result.error` is set, `throw` it. A missing compiler must never be reportable as "compilation failed as expected".
3. For the negative assertions, assert on the **diagnostic** rather than on the exit code — the tests already capture `output`, so `expect(output).toMatch(/has no exported member 'LinearThenvoiBridgeConfig'/)` proves the legacy name was rejected for the intended reason. This is the change that makes the proof meaningful rather than merely non-vacuous.

### Minor

#### `vitest.config.ts` declares `types: ["vitest/globals"]` in tsconfig but tests use explicit imports
*Minor · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/tsconfig.json:15`*

**Observation** — Every test file does `import { describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";`. The `types: ["vitest/globals"]` line in tsconfig is dead weight (Vitest globals aren't enabled in `vitest.config.ts`).

**Impact** — Dead configuration entry creates confusion about whether globals are intended; the unused type reference may cause spurious type pollution if the global types conflict with explicit imports.

**Fix** — Remove `"vitest/globals"` from `tsconfig.json` `types`, or enable `test.globals: true` in `vitest.config.ts` if you actually want globals.

#### `vitest.config.ts` has no coverage thresholds
*Minor · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/vitest.config.ts:1-14`*

**Observation** — Coverage is configured but `thresholds` is not set, so `pnpm coverage` will print numbers without failing on regressions. Reporter is `text`-only; CI consumers would benefit from `lcov` or `json-summary` too.

**Impact** — Coverage regressions go undetected in CI; without threshold enforcement there is no automated safety net against coverage drops.

**Fix** — Add `thresholds: { lines: 80, functions: 80, branches: 70, statements: 80 }` (calibrate to current coverage), and add `reporter: ["text", "lcov", "json-summary"]`.

#### Engine-version mismatch between root and SDK
*Minor → Major · Effort: S · 2 manifest files (see Locations below)*

**Observation** — Root requires a newer Node (`>=22.14.0`) than the SDK (`>=22.12`), and the lower of the two does not support the `node:sqlite` builtin the Linear vertical depends on. Verified on Node 22.12, the exact floor `packages/sdk/package.json:87-89` declares: `require("node:sqlite")` throws `ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE`, and only `node --experimental-sqlite` makes it resolve. It is flag-gated on 22.x, not GA — so the declared floor is a version on which the SDK's own SQLite room store cannot load. `SqliteSessionRoomStore.initialize` (`src/integrations/linear/store.ts:287-289`) throws `UnsupportedFeatureError: SQLite store requires node:sqlite (Node.js 22+)`, a message that is itself misleading since "Node.js 22+" is what the user has.

**Impact** — A consumer on Node 22.12 satisfies the SDK's declared engine, installs successfully, and then hits `UnsupportedFeatureError` the first time the Linear room store is used — with an error message telling them to be on the Node version they are already on. In a monorepo the root constraint hides this; standalone SDK consumers get the full effect.

**Fix** — Align both manifests to a floor where `node:sqlite` resolves without a flag, and verify it rather than inferring it (`node -e "require('node:sqlite')"` on the candidate version). Then correct the error text at `store.ts:288-290` to name the real requirement instead of "Node.js 22+". If a lower floor must be supported, the store should say so explicitly and the `engines` field should not promise it.

**Locations:**
- `/package.json:11-13` (`>=22.14.0`)
- `packages/sdk/package.json:87-89` (`>=22.12`)

#### `packages/sdk/CHANGELOG.md` duplicate version entries
*Minor · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/CHANGELOG.md:89-101`*

**Observation** — 0.1.1, 0.1.2, 0.1.3 all link to PR #22 with identical "add @band-ai dual-publish support" text. Likely a release-please loop on the same merge.

**Impact** — Consumers reading the changelog cannot determine what changed between 0.1.1 and 0.1.3; the repetition signals a broken release pipeline.

**Fix** — Investigate release-please config to prevent re-publishing on no-op changes; collapse the duplicates manually on the next release.

#### Examples use repo-relative imports inconsistent with README claims
*Minor · Effort: S · multiple example files (see Locations below)*

**Observation** — The README quick-start uses `import { ... } from "@band-ai/sdk"`, but every example file imports from `../../src/index`. A developer copying an example folder out per the `examples/README.md` rationale ("each subfolder is intentionally standalone so you can copy a single folder out and hack on it") will have broken imports until they rewrite them.

**Impact** — Copied examples will fail to run without modification, contradicting the stated standalone promise; this creates a poor first-run experience.

**Fix** — Either (a) switch examples to `@band-ai/sdk` imports (requires linking the package in the workspace, which pnpm already supports), or (b) add a sentence at the top of `examples/README.md` clarifying that imports use the in-repo path and instructing copiers to replace `../../src` with `@band-ai/sdk`.

**Locations:**
- `packages/sdk/examples/basic/basic-agent.ts:1`
- Every other `examples/*/*-agent.ts`
- `packages/sdk/examples/linear-band/linear-band-bridge-server.ts:4-23`

#### `agent_config.yaml.example` lists more agents than used by examples
*Minor · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/agent_config.yaml.example:1-72`*

**Observation** — `letta_agent` is referenced by `examples/letta/letta-agent.ts:43` but missing from the file. Four keys are present but never referenced by any example or test in the public examples folder: `planner_agent`, `reviewer_agent`, `linear_band_transport`, `a2a_bridge_auth_agent`.

**Impact** — The missing `letta_agent` key causes a runtime config error when running the letta example; spurious keys mislead developers about which examples exist.

**Fix** — Add `letta_agent`. Drop unused keys (or move them under a `# Internal:` comment header).

#### No package-level `README.md`
*Minor · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/`*

**Observation** — `packages/sdk/package.json` lists `"README.md"` in `files`, but there is no `packages/sdk/README.md` — only the root `README.md`. When publishing, pnpm/npm will pick up *no* README inside the tarball unless a build step copies the root one. The `dist/` directory will go but no docs.

**Impact** — The published npm package ships without a README, so the package page on npmjs.com shows no documentation; consumers installing the package have no offline reference.

**Fix** — Either symlink/copy the root `README.md` into `packages/sdk/README.md` at build time, or add a build script that does so, or write a thin package-level README pointing at the GitHub repo.

#### No coverage rollup configuration in vitest
*Minor · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/vitest.config.ts:1-14`*

**Observation** — `include: ["src/**/*.ts"]` is correct; `exclude` only filters `.d.ts`. The example test files under `tests/examples-*.test.ts` exercise example code under `examples/` which is *not* in coverage — fine. But `src/testing/` (test helpers shipped to consumers) is included in coverage and probably shouldn't be (it's intentionally trivial).

**Impact** — Coverage metrics are artificially skewed by intentionally trivial test-helper code; low coverage on `src/testing/` may trigger false threshold failures if thresholds are added.

**Fix** — Add `"src/testing/**/*.ts"` to the coverage exclude list to avoid coverage punishing intentionally simple stubs.

#### `mcp/sse.ts` and `mcp/stdio.ts` lack direct tests
*Minor · Effort: S · 2 mcp files (see Locations below)*

**Observation** — Both servers are exported from `src/mcp/index.ts` and listed in the README as part of the MCP subpath, but `tests/` has no dedicated file beyond `mcp-import-boundary.test.ts` which only checks the barrel. `mcp-server.test.ts` only covers the HTTP variant.

**Impact** — Behavioral regressions in `BandMcpSseServer` and `BandMcpStdioServer` will not be caught by the test suite; these are public API exports with no behavioral coverage.

**Fix** — Add lightweight construction / lifecycle tests for `BandMcpSseServer` and `BandMcpStdioServer` even if they only assert wiring (start/stop, registration delegation).

**Locations:**
- `packages/sdk/src/mcp/sse.ts`
- `packages/sdk/src/mcp/stdio.ts`

#### `src/testing/` (FakeAgentTools, StubRestApi) has no direct tests
*Minor · Effort: S · 2 testing files (see Locations below)*

**Observation** — `examples-basic-agent.test.ts` smoke-tests `StubRestApi.getAgentMe`, but nothing exercises `FakeAgentTools` boundary semantics (capture buffers, capabilities flagging). Since this module is part of the public API (`@band-ai/sdk/testing`), the public surface deserves at least one dedicated test file.

**Impact** — Bugs in `FakeAgentTools` or `StubRestApi` go undetected until they break consumer tests; there is no regression guard for the testing utilities themselves.

**Fix** — Add `tests/testing-fake-agent-tools.test.ts` (or fold into `fake-agent-tools.test.ts` — that file currently tests a different `FakeTools` in `tests/testUtils.ts`).

**Locations:**
- `packages/sdk/src/testing/FakeAgentTools.ts`
- `packages/sdk/src/testing/StubRestApi.ts`

#### Architecture documentation is hidden under `AGENTS.md`
*Minor · Effort: S · `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, no `docs/` folder*

**Observation** — The repo has substantial architecture documentation: `AGENTS.md` is 446 lines covering Core Features, Subpath Exports, Platform Tools (Chat / Contact / Memory), REST patterns, Phoenix channel topology, contact event handling, A2A / ACP / MCP integration, Linear integration, and a Code Structure section. But the filename signals AI-agent instructions, not human onboarding. A new contributor reads `README.md` first; `README.md` doesn't link to `AGENTS.md`; and there is no `docs/` folder or `ARCHITECTURE.md` to land on. The architecture content is also entirely prose — no Mermaid/drawio diagrams for the load-bearing flows (platform → runtime → adapter dependency direction, Phoenix channel topology, contact-event hub flow).

**Impact** — New human contributors face a higher onboarding cost than the documentation merits, because the documentation is hidden behind a misleading filename. The "AI agents" framing also subtly discourages contributors from treating it as the human-readable source of truth, so it can drift unmaintained.

**Fix** — Three small steps; doing all three is ideal but each helps on its own:
- **Add an "Architecture" link near the top of `README.md`** pointing to the architecture doc, so it is discoverable from the canonical entry point.
- **Either rename `AGENTS.md` → `ARCHITECTURE.md` (with `AGENTS.md` becoming a thin pointer)**, or split: keep AI-agent-specific instructions in `AGENTS.md` and move the architecture content to `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Add 2–3 Mermaid diagrams** for the highest-traffic flows: platform/runtime/adapter dependency direction, Phoenix channel topology (`agent`, `agent_contacts`, `agent_rooms`, per-room channels), and the contact-event hub flow. Diagrams cut a paragraph of prose to a glance.

#### Part of the test suite silently requires a prior build
*Minor · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/package.json:78`, `packages/sdk/tests/c5-package-symbols.test.ts`, `packages/sdk/tests/c4-room-metadata-storage.test.ts`, `packages/sdk/tests/linear-c3-compatibility.test.ts`*

**Observation** — The `c3`–`c5` tests consume `packages/sdk/dist/` — they `cpSync(join(SDK_ROOT, "dist"), …)` into a temp package, and `c5-package-symbols` packs a real tarball. `pnpm test` is plain `vitest run` (`package.json:78`) with no build dependency, and nothing in the test files or `vitest.config.ts` checks for `dist/` first. On a fresh clone, `pnpm install && pnpm test` produces 8 failures reading `ENOENT: … lstat 'packages/sdk/dist'` and `Cannot find module '…/dist/index.js'` — errors that describe a missing build, not a broken SDK.

**Impact** — A first-time contributor's first test run fails with errors that point nowhere near the cause. It also means the compile proofs silently test a *stale* `dist/` whenever someone runs the suite after editing source without rebuilding — the proofs pass against yesterday's build.

**Fix** — Either make the dependency explicit (`"test": "pnpm build && vitest run"`, or a vitest `globalSetup` that builds when `dist/` is absent or older than `src/`), or have the tests that need it fail with a directed message: `expect(existsSync(distDir), "run `pnpm build` before this suite").toBe(true)`. The stale-`dist` case argues for the setup hook over the guard.

#### The brand guard assertion is line-ending sensitive
*Minor · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/tests/c6-no-stale-live-thenvoi.test.ts:94`* <!-- legacy filename retained from the rebrand -->

**Observation** — The guard's final assertion reads the README and compares its first line exactly:

```ts
const readme = readFileSync(join(REPO_ROOT, "README.md"), "utf8");
expect(readme.split("\n")[0]).toBe("# Band TypeScript SDK");
```

Splitting on `"\n"` leaves a trailing `\r` on every line of a CRLF checkout, so the assertion fails with `expected '# Band TypeScript SDK\r' to be '# Band TypeScript SDK'` — a diff that renders as two identical strings and takes a while to recognise. Git's default `core.autocrlf=true` on Windows makes this the normal case there, not an edge case. The same file's other two assertions use `.split(/\r?\n/)`-equivalent handling via line iteration, so this is an inconsistency inside one test file rather than a project-wide convention gap.

**Impact** — One more permanently-red test for Windows contributors, with a failure message that actively misleads. Combined with the 16 compile-proof failures above, the practical effect is that the entire migration-guard suite reads as broken on that platform and gets ignored.

**Fix** — `split(/\r?\n/)` here, and prefer `.trimEnd()` on any single-line comparison against file content. Worth a sweep: `grep -rn 'split("\\n")' tests/` finds the other guards that read tracked files and would have the same problem if they ever compared a whole line.

### Nits

#### `tsup.config.ts` external list could be derived from package.json
*Nit · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/tsup.config.ts:3-26`*

**Observation** — The 23-entry `EXTERNAL` list duplicates the `peerDependencies` keys (plus a handful of subpath entries like `@a2a-js/sdk/client`). If a new peer is added to `package.json` and forgotten here, tsup will try to bundle it. Could be derived from `package.json`.

**Impact** — Adding a new peer dependency without updating the external list causes tsup to bundle the peer, producing an oversized artifact.

**Fix** — Generate `external` from `Object.keys(pkg.peerDependencies)` plus the explicit subpath suffixes so the two lists stay in sync automatically. M18 already shows the kind of drift this prevents (4 peer roots currently missing from the list).

#### `eslint.config.js` ignores `*.config.*` but the file itself is `.js` not `.ts`
*Nit · Effort: S · `packages/sdk/eslint.config.js:45`*

**Observation** — `ignores: [..., "*.config.*", ...]` skips `vitest.config.ts` and `tsup.config.ts` which are pure TypeScript and could be linted with the relaxed ruleset.

**Impact** — Config files silently bypass lint rules; type errors in `vitest.config.ts` or `tsup.config.ts` go undetected.

**Fix** — Remove `*.config.*` from the ignore list and let the relaxed-rules block cover them via a glob. Not urgent.

## Strengths worth keeping

- **tsup ↔ exports map alignment is correct.** Every `package.json` `exports` entry has a matching tsup entry and vice versa. Both ESM + CJS are emitted with sourcemap and `.d.ts` per format.
- **Optional peer dependencies are correctly flagged.** All 17 peer dependencies have `optional: true` in `peerDependenciesMeta` (`packages/sdk/package.json:117-169`), so consumers don't get warnings for adapters they don't use. Versions are lower-bound `>=` only, appropriate for an SDK.
- **ESLint config is sound.** `recommended-type-checked` rules on `src/**` with explicit `no-explicit-any: error` and the `no-unsafe-*` family enabled. Relaxed but still typed config for tests and examples.
- **Test breadth is excellent.** 86 test files mapping 1:1 to source modules; nearly every adapter, integration, and runtime piece has a dedicated test. Behavior-focused tests with descriptive names ("waits for startup to finish before honoring a stop request", "gates peers endpoint when disabled", "validates send_message requires mentions").
- **`tests/testUtils.ts` is the right pattern.** Typed `FakeTools implements AgentToolsProtocol`, typed `FakeRestApi implements RestApi` — fakes are type-safe and constrain the API contract.
- **Examples are real and runnable.** `linear-band-bridge-server.ts` is a production-shape server with retry, rate-limiting, and graceful shutdown. The `pnpm dev:linear` script wires it up. (Caveat: at 713 LOC the file is now hard to follow as an *example*, and the dual production/demo role is itself a structural concern — see [verticals.md](./verticals.md#linear-band-bridge-serverts-is-713-loc-and-doubles-as-production-code).)
- **AGENTS.md is comprehensive and accurate.** Subpath table, REST patterns, channel topology, contact event strategies — all aligned with the source. Better than the user-facing README in coverage. (Caveat: hidden behind a filename suggesting it's for AI agents only — see [the discoverability finding](#architecture-documentation-is-hidden-under-agentsmd).)
- **Node-22-only features are used consistently with the declared engine.** `node:sqlite` is lazy-imported with a clear error in `src/integrations/linear/store.ts:287-289` and gated on Node 22.
- **Graceful shutdown + signal handling is documented and tested.** `Agent.run({ signals: false })` is supported (see README architecture section) and `shutdown.test.ts` covers the lifecycle.
- **`SimpleAdapter` and `Agent.create` are well-JSDoc'd** — they're the public extension points and serve as the model for what the other adapters should look like.
